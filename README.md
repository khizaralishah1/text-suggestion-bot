# Chat-bot or Text Suggestion
Sat, November 13, 2021.
Today I made some initial things. The main screen in which the computer asks user his/her name. Then user is welcomed. He/she is asked their feelings. The answer will be scored with its frequency (initially 1) in the words.txt file. 

My idea is: With more and more words written by the user, the frequencies in words.txt file will increase and new words will be added. It is as if the computer is learning these words, and they will permanently remain with it. Next step is that computer will be able to suggest the user some, maybe 3, words while the user is writing anything. Just like when we write message in our phones and get auto-correct words. When I write "H", I might get "Happy", "Honest", etc in the suggestion. And the suggestions will change with every next character written.
Last step, as of my thinking at this point, is that the computer will be able to make sentences out of those words. Gramatically correct. The words will be arranged systematically as nouns, verbs, etc.
